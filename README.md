## ⚙️ Features

- Recognizes human actions in videos/images 🎥
- Lightweight and optimized ResNet-34 ONNX model 🧠
- Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive web app 🖥️
- Clean UI and real-time classification ⏱️

## 🧠 Model

We use the **ResNet-34 trained on Kinetics dataset**, exported as an ONNX model for efficient inference.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veeru594/human-action-recognition.git
   cd human-action-recognition/main/Code/HumanAction
